# Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft: Galactic Space Craft Control
Welcome to the repository for the Galactic Space Craft Control program for Chandrayaan 3, developed by ISRO scientists.
This program translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft, enabling it to navigate through the galaxy using galactic coordinates.

## Description

As a scientist at ISRO controlling the latest lunar spacecraft Chandrayaan 3,your task is to develop a program that navigates the spacecraft through the galaxy based on the provided commands. The spacecraft's movement and rotations are defined within a specific reference frame, and it operates under certain constraints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Functionalities

The program implements the following functionalities for controlling the spacecraft:

- Move the spacecraft forward/backward (f, b): Move one step forward or backward based on the current direction.
- Turn the spacecraft left/right (l, r): Rotate 90 degrees to the left or right, changing the facing direction.
- Turn the spacecraft up/down (u, d): Change the angle, rotating upwards or downwards.

## Files
The repository consists of three essential files. The file named "incubyte.py" comprises the main function that governs the program's functionality. Additionally, the "incubyte_unit.py" file contains the user inputs required for the program to execute. At the conclusion of the repository, the "incubyte_test.py" file encompasses the test cases for validating the program's accuracy.
